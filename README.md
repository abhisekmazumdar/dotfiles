# Introduction

This is my dotfiles for setting up my macOS.

## Setting up your Mac

After generating a new SSH key and adding it to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles with:
    
    ```shell
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:abhisekmazumdar/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
2. Run the installation with:

    ```shell
    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./fresh.sh
    ```

## Cleaning the old Mac (optionally)

After you've set up your new Mac you may want to wipe and clean install your old Mac. [Follow this](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac) article to do that. Remember to backup your data first!
